# Cristo Rey Catecismo

This React web app was created to help the students of Cristo Rey Catecismo study. Students are required to learn prayers, "The 92 questions", and other important information. There are two sections in this app. The first section is the Prayers section, this contains prayers and other important information for the students to review. The second section is the Flashcard section, this section allows students to enter the range of the questions they wish to study as flashcards. Students learn in both English and Spanish, this app is able to display the information in both languages.
